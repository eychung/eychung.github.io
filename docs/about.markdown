## Salutations and Felicitations
Welcome to my photography space! I enjoy taking landscape photos of architecture, cities, and nature.

I built this site mainly to share my hobby with friends and loved ones.

For me, I remember the moments in my travels better when looking back at the pictures I have taken. It is also these moments that I love to share with people.
