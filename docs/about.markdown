## Salutations and Felicitations
Welcome to my photography space! I enjoy taking landscape photos of architecture, cities, and nature. I built this site mainly to share my hobby with friends and loved ones. For me, I remember the moments in my travels better when looking back at the pictures I have taken. It is also these moments that I love to share with people.

### Camera
All the pictures shot here are taken with phone. I am currently using a Samsung S23 since 2020 and previously, a Samsung S9.

### Website
If you are interested in building a similar site, I have released my site template on GitHub at [https://github.com/eychung/jekyrll-gallery-website-template/releases](https://github.com/eychung/jekyrll-gallery-website-template/releases). Please view [README.md](https://github.com/eychung/jekyrll-gallery-website-template/blob/main/README.md) for information on how to get started.
